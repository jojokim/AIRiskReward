                Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is a trending technology defined by <a href="#readings">Rosie</a> as
                the capability of a computer program to perform task and reasoning process. A.I. makes its own decisions
                based on datum and practices so that the outcome of its decisions is desirable. Because of computer’s
                computational power, not only it can help people reduce errors and maximize the effects of their work,
                but also perform tasks for you with high accuracy. For example, it can diagnose patient,
                <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/robotics/medical-robots/autonomous-robot-surgeon-bests-human-surgeons-in-world-first">perform surgeries</a>
                with less errors or mistakes compared to how much human make. And also, it can drive your car to your
                desired destination faster and safer. There is no doubt. It certainly is beneficial for people to adopt
                A.I. when it comes to a work that requires speed and accuracy. <br/><br/>
                However, there is risk that must be taken, and it's huge. Because A.I. can teach itself just like how
                <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-ai-artificial-intelligence-taught-itself-walk-2017-7">Google's Deep Mind</a>
                taught itself to walk and run, it's potential is very dangerous to humans. Once it teaches a lot of different
                things and gain more ability to perform certain actions, it can possibly be harmful since it will perform what
                ever actions that will lead to its desired outcome. If it’s purpose is to make the Earth environmentally healthier,
                 it could teach itself how to eliminate a smoker. Furthermore, if an A.I. is optimized to be harmful to human by
                 someone’s evil intention or by someone’s mistake, that will just be catastrophic. It will learn so fast and
                 harm human as best as it can. <br/><br/>
                  Because A.I. has two enormous sides to consider, it is currently being a huge debate in the society. Eventually we will have
                 to decide whether to use this fascinating but scary technology. <br/><br/>
                 This site presents three different groups of people who have made their decisions and settled their thoughts on Artificial Intelligence.

            Artificial Intelligence supporters are fascinated by the benefits that it can bring. Due to Its speed,
            accuracy, and the ability to do fast computational work, A.I. is capable of doing so many great things.
            It can replace mundane tasks so that people never have to do extra inefficient work. Faster actions and
            decisions are another part where the supporters are considering.<br/><br/>
            When it comes to medical fields, taking less time for a decision could simply save so many of the lives. Not only l
            ess decision time, but also the precision in its decision and actions will save more lives. Pediatric surgeon
             <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/robotics/medical-robots/autonomous-robot-surgeon-bests-human-surgeons-in-world-first">Peter Kim</a>
            also agrees to the power of artificial intelligence by mentioning that having a machine to work with doctors to
            enhance the result and safety will be a huge benefit.<br/><br/>
            As <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/07/25/facebook_ceo_mark_zuckerberg_ai_naysayers_like_elon_musk_are_really_negative_pretty_irresponsible.html">Mark Zuckerberg</a>
            says he’s really optimistic about Artificial Intelligence, he points out technology in general can be used for good
            or bad, and that you need to be careful about what you build and how it is going to be used. He mentions how A.I. can
            help diagnose diseases better, and match up drugs to people, and how self-driving car can be so much safer than
            human driving and it will lead to saving bunch of lives.<br/><br/>
            The optimistic views are very reasonable and for sure Artificial Intelligence is a technology that will bring many
            benefits in our lives. In fact, it is already bringing lots of benefits. However, we shouldn’t be blinded by all
            those luxury benefits that it can bring to us. There is a huge relying on the other side. we have to be aware,
            and make decisions based on it, and for the most important part, we have to have the access to control. If we lose
            control over the A.I. that we built, that will be the start of cascade.

            Artificial Intelligence indeed has many potential dangers and problems. Opposers are very worried about these hazardous dangers.
            How bad could it be? It could potentially eliminate all mankind. Yes, just like terminator tried to do. In fact, many top A.I.
            researchers are concerned about it.
            <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/11/07/stephen-hawking-says-artificial-intelligence-could-destroy-humanity.html">Stephen Hawking</a>
            gave a warning at Web Summit in Lisbon. He argued that people simply can’t figure out if we will benefit from it or be sidelined
            or killed by it. A.I. used in weaponries is undoubtedly malicious. Using all its power and ability, it will achieve its goal
            which is to kill people in this case. What happens if there is a small flaw in the code for detecting the target, the outcome
            will never be close to happiness.<br/><br/>
            Another very crucial point that A.I could be hazardous is that it can teach itself to do certain action. What does that mean? It means
            that A.I. will grow and improve at a very fast speed.
            <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x">Elon Musk</a>
            even mentioned that the purpose of his investment on Google’s DeepMind is to keep an eye on how A.I. are improving. Once we let A.I. learn about everything,
            we never know what it’s capable of, and what its next actions would be.<br/><br/>
            Some of the opposers have argued that distinction of human race might occur due to A.I. and it seems to hold credibility. We might reach a point where we no
            longer have no control of A.I., and it becomes a being itself so that it will perform any actions that it thinks to be beneficial in its own standard.
            But I want to argue that there must be a safety pin that people could regulate A.I. from going out of control. If we are not sure how to control A.I.
            we shouldn’t just use it now. Instead, we should try our best to have full control over A.I. Then we will be able to earn all those benefits without any concerns.

          <div class="mb-5">
            Not only benefits and risks but also ethics is being a huge perspective of Artificial Intelligence. Some people focus more on
            ethical issues derived from A.I. rather than other consequences of it. One of the biggest issue that Artificial Intelligence
            ethical thinkers present is who should design and how should moral standard be designed? A company called
            <a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/">Moral Machine</a>
            tries to solve this by setting a human standard formed by people entering their judges for
            certain scenario, and trying to set the machine moral as the most accepted one. Whatever it would end up with, it would
            not be able to satisfy everyone for sure.<br/><br/>
            Another biggest part to consider is the trust between Artificial intelligence and human. For people to utilize A.I. we
            have to trust its behavior, and let it do its calculated actions. A.I. in surgery might perform a move that any of the
            doctors never thought of. Then doctors either have to trust A.I. and let it do perform its calculated actions, or not
            trust it and go for a move within their knowledge. As Mark C. Smith Chair in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and
            Computer Engineering quotes “We need to ensure that our robots, when placed in situations that evoke trust, are also
            designed to mitigate that trust when trust is detrimental to the human.”  <br/><br/>
            It is very hard to solve all the ethical issues driven from using Artificial Intelligence. Whatever we choose to proceed
            with, there will be ethical problems associated with the use of A.I. I argue that in order to fully adopt A.I. in our lives,
            we have to have a standard, a rule, a common agreement, that will justify certain actions of A.I. to be morally acceptable
            by human. Otherwise, it will keep creating more and more problems and issues.
